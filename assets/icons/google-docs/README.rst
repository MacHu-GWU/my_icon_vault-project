This is the Google Docs icon, representing Google's cloud-based word processing application. The icon displays a blue document with a folded corner in the top-right and three white horizontal lines of varying lengths representing text on the page. Google Docs is widely used for creating, editing, and collaborating on text documents in real-time, offering features similar to traditional word processors but with cloud storage and multi-user collaboration capabilities.
