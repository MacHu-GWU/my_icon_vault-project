This is the Google Photos icon, representing Google's photo storage and management service. The icon features a pinwheel or flower-like design composed of four rounded petals in Google's signature colors: yellow, red, blue, and green, arranged in a symmetrical pattern that suggests movement and organization. Google Photos is used for backing up, storing, organizing, and sharing photos and videos in the cloud, with intelligent search capabilities, automatic album creation, and editing tools powered by AI.
