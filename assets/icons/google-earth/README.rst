This is the Google Earth icon, representing Google's virtual globe and geographic exploration application. The icon features a circular design with flowing, layered waves in varying shades of blue, from deep navy at the bottom to light sky blue at the top, creating an abstract representation of Earth's oceans and atmosphere. Google Earth is used for exploring satellite imagery, maps, terrain, 3D buildings, and geographic data, allowing users to virtually travel anywhere on the planet and view locations from street level to outer space perspectives.
