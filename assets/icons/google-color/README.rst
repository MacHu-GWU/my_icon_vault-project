This is the main Google logo icon, displaying the capital letter "G" in Google's signature multi-color palette with a rainbow gradient that flows through red-coral at the top, transitioning through yellow-gold on the left, green at the bottom, and blue on the right side. This iconic "G" serves as the universal symbol for Google's core search engine and represents the company's broader suite of services, apps, and digital products across web and mobile platforms.
