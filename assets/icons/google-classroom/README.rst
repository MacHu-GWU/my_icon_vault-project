This is the Google Classroom icon, an educational technology platform represented by a green chalkboard with white silhouettes of three people (a teacher and students) centered on it, all contained within a yellow-gold rounded square border. The icon's design evokes a traditional classroom setting while maintaining Google's modern, flat design aesthetic. Google Classroom is used by educators and students for assignment management, class communication, and educational collaboration in schools and learning environments.
