This is a Confluence icon featuring two white curved paper or page shapes on a bright blue rounded square background. The icon uses a modern, flat design style with the white shapes appearing to overlap or float against the solid blue backdrop. This represents Atlassian's Confluence collaboration and documentation platform, used for team wikis, knowledge bases, and project documentation.
