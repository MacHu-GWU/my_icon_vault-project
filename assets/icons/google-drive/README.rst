This is the Google Drive icon, representing Google's cloud storage and file synchronization service. The icon features a distinctive triangular shape composed of three colored segments: green on the left, yellow on the right, and blue at the bottom, with a small red accent, forming an impossible triangle optical illusion. Google Drive is used for storing files in the cloud, sharing documents, photos, and other content, and serves as the underlying storage system for Google Workspace applications like Docs, Sheets, and Slides.RetryClaude can make mistakes.
