This is the Google Colab (Colaboratory) icon, representing Google's cloud-based Jupyter notebook platform for collaborative coding and data science work. The icon features two interlocking circular rings in warm orange and yellow tones that form the letters "CO," with a gradient that transitions from deeper orange to bright yellow, creating a continuous, flowing design. Google Colab is widely used by data scientists, researchers, and developers for writing and executing Python code, machine learning experiments, and collaborative computational projects directly in the browser without requiring local setup.
