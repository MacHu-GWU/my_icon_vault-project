This is the Google Play Store icon, representing Google's official app marketplace and digital distribution platform for Android devices. The icon features a colorful triangular play button design divided into four segments: green at the top, blue on the left, red at the bottom, and yellow on the right, all forming a rightward-pointing arrow or play symbol. Google Play Store is used for discovering, downloading, and purchasing Android apps, games, movies, books, and other digital content, serving as the primary source for software on Android smartphones and tablets.
