This is the modern Microsoft Windows logo icon featuring four equally-sized squares arranged in a 2x2 grid pattern. The squares are colored in Microsoft's signature palette: orange-red (top left), bright green (top right), blue (bottom left), and yellow-gold (bottom right), separated by thin white lines. This clean, flat design represents the Microsoft brand and Windows operating system, commonly used to identify Microsoft products, Windows applications, and as the start menu icon in Windows interfaces as of 2025.
