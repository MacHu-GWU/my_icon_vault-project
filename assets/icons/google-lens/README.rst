This is the Google Lens icon, representing Google's visual search and image recognition technology. The icon features a stylized camera design with a blue camera body and lens circle in the center, accompanied by colorful corner elements in yellow, red, and green that suggest a scanning or framing function. Google Lens allows users to search and understand what they see through their camera, enabling features like object identification, text translation, plant and animal recognition, barcode scanning, and visual product searches by simply pointing their device's camera at real-world objects.
